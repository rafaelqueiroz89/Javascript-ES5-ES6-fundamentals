# Javascript-fundamentals
In this repository I am studying the different forms of javascript code so I can later start messing with Node.js =)

This is a follow-up to a course I am talking about ES6. I am using Visual Studio 2017 as my IDE. It will not contain any information about the code because it is for academic research only.
